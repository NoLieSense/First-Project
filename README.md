# First-Project
My first project in my journey of learning python 

This project is a beginner-friendly guessing game implemented in Python. It uses the random library to let the computer pick a chest at random from a list of options. Conditional statements (if/elif) are used to provide hints and determine whether the player’s choice matches the computer’s. User input is taken via the input() function, and string comparisons handle validation. The program demonstrates the use of lists, functions, randomness, and branching logic, making it a simple introduction to Python’s core features.
